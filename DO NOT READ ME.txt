USE: {
	VSCODE with autosave
	NPM instead of yarn
	GOOGLE CHROME ALWAYS (control click -> inspect element) -> opens debug menu
	ES6 SYNTAX (https://www.taniarascia.com/es6-syntax-and-feature-overview/)
}

to use mongodb or postico, you may need your own computer (or run a vm)

https://www.freecodecamp.org/ is also a good resource for learning web dev!

Resources folder contains some other useful tools.



I recommend:
Start with running install-dependencies.sh
then getting started with the material in learn-web-dev
Number ranks difficulty, FE is front-end, BE is back-end, FS is fullstack
put projects inside their corresponding folders.



If you have any questions, Slack me at tsehr on the old slack or BIG SOCK on the new slack!

Personal Notes: 
	Create A Webpage to track user engagement on curriculum.
